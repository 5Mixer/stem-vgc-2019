# stem-vgc-2019
STEM Video Game Challange 2019 Project. Theme: Emergence.

Initial mechanic based around adding regions to the game environment that temporarily modify the properties of game entities - for instance mass, friction, gravity, 'flame' status, etc.
This may change as the project is incomplete.
